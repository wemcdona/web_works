    <p>Part One:
    Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. Governs how clients get data from, or send data to a server.
    URL is Short for Uniform Resource Locator. It is an address for an internet resource.
    DNS is short for Domain Name System. It takes URLs that people read and turns them into an IP address for computers to read.
    The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL.
    GET - retrieves data from the server with no side effects
    POST - send data to the server with side effects
    An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol
    An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol
    Headers provide additional information about the request or the response
    Example: request headers: host, user-agent, accept, cookie, chache-control
    Example: resonse headers: content-type, last-modified, set-cookie, chache-control
    your browser resolves the name into an IP address using DNS, then makes a request to that IP address, including headers. the server sends a response. the browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and recieves response from the server for each
